31,Big thank you to the mods.,"I disagree completely with the assertion that we need memes back.

I have learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from WSB ever since 10,000,000 apes piled in here with their bullshit pictures and jokes. It's funny sure, but I want to make some fucking money. I am not here to get a little chuckle at how much money you lost because you YOLO'd your entire portfolio on a single Jim Cramer tip.

Things were WAY better before.

I was creeping this place back when we had like 300k members, and buddy, I learned some serious shit. Everyone once in a while, I swear the smartest mother fuckers in the world would step down from their ivory towers on Wall Street and bless some scrubs with information that their bosses would pay them 8 figures to write. This subreddit had top quality DD written by absolute professionals who were slinging around millions of dollars.

The DD's back then were real, not just a bunch of morons trying to justify their latest gamble into a trash penny stock.

Sure you miss your stupid fucking pictures of the exact same photo with new text about the latest shitty company that flopped earnings.

Do you know what was even better than memes? When I came in here and saw people piling into Hertz the day it declared bankruptcy and they all made bank.

How about the time we all got the bright idea to pile into BlackBerry days before they signed a deal with Amazon and it went vertical?

Do you know what else was fucking wicked? When dozens of people in WSB concocted conspiracy theories about Palantir, and this entire sub jumped into the direct listing at $9 before a single institution got in, and we tripled our money in two months. (After sure enough - Joe Biden hired a former PLTR consultant to run the entire department of national security.)

I cannot recall a single community win like this since the memes took over, and I still come to the sub multiple times a day.

Do you really think all these moronic TikTok screenshot GIFs are going to help you find the next game stonk at $2.50? Fuck off.

Fuck your memes. Go back to Instagram and Twitch with the rest of the broke kiddos.",sjyn3q,16148,1590,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjyn3q/big_thank_you_to_the_mods/

BOOM pro is a script made by this guy. And he fucks. Hard:   https://www.tradingview.com/u/veryfid/  

MACD and RSI you should know, if not, wait for Cramer to tell you about it on CNBC ya boomer.  

The sequence to look for with GME is:  

*	The Boom Pro Signal line (the WHITE line amongst the agglomeration of Center of Gravity a.k.a COG oscillators) finds a bottom after a high point.  

*	The Red COG cloud establishes an uptrend.  

*	The signal line finds resistance (red line) in it‚Äôs first top after the red cloud has established it‚Äôs uptrend. (YELLOW circles)  

*	When the signal line breaks the resistance (red line) the rocket is launching (GREEN vertical line)  

*	This is confirmed by MACD, RSI, and a stochastic pop indicator made by another guy who fucks:  https://www.tradingview.com/u/ChrisMoody/  

As you can see this is a leading indicator strategy with multiple confirms, with a high success rate for GME.

Lo an behold, I talk to one of you autists in chat who's sure the market is going to blow up at open. I disagree and go on my way.

Then at open the market moves a little bit up, I'm waiting for a good entry on my puts, I go to pull the trigger and ... I immediately switch, think I'm wrong, and the market is going to move up. I BUY FUCKING MOTHERFUCKING RANDOM ASS CALLS.

20 minutes later, I'm down 80% and $4600, and I have no fucking idea what the fuck I'm even holding. I'm literally playing the opposite of my plan and I decide on this new plan at the worst possible time.  I went long at literally the exact HOD. Like, to the minute.

""Incorporating volume into the price data makes it easier to search for  confirmation of trend reversals, support and resistance breaks, or  buying/selling pressure. The latter is best estimated with the close  price display on as multiple studies use its position within the range  as an indication of whether the buyers or sellers are in control.  Plotting the close price in the Equivolume boxes also serves as a visual  reference of trend strength or weakness.""

Since i got accused of plagirism, it was put in quotes , the definition of Equivolume pulled from TDA, since im sure not many used it before. Saving you the trouble of searching.

I mean, there are no guarantees

https://i.redd.it/bl0p5v7k1pg81.gif

# Step 1.

Open up several new brokerage accounts on : Charles Schwab, Fidelity, IBKR, Etrade, TD Ameritrade

# Step 2.

Transfer all your shares to one of the other brokerages you have an account at.

# Step 3. 

When the shares clear..   go to Step 2 and Do it again, faggot.  


[wsb retard after step 3.. \\""What was step 2?\\""](https://i.redd.it/2naekfh83pg81.gif)

&#x200B;

# Now you ask ""Why the fuck would I do this?""

  
This will force these brokerages to actually handle your shares and move them to other brokerages, if those shares don't actually exist, then they will have to buy them and move them... Keep doing this every few days/weeks, to keep the MM on their toes. They will have to document all the moves to the SEC. If enough people do this for the meme stocks, it could force margin calls on hedge funds that are over leveraged. Hard to manipulate when those shares keep getting named to a new brokerage/owner every few days.  


&#x200B;

&#x200B;

^(Warning, this is not legitimate advice. This is the crazy rant of a madman. There are risks that your shares could end up in limbo for extended periods of time, and during that period you will not be able to buy or sell. I just like stocks.)

I work in tech, and my best estimation is that the Metaverse announcement was literally *because* FB could see the writing on the wall internally, and knew they were going to miss on earnings, so they had to create *some* narrative which would justify holding FB.

Social networks have a couple important properties:

1. They're generational - people tend to use the network which their age cohort is using.  The younger generation flocks to a new network during high-school age to avoid their parents, and then gradually the older generation starts to pile in.

2. They rely on network effects.  There's always going to be at most a couple ""winners"" and everyone will move to those because a social network is worthless once people feel like that's not where the activity is.

FB managed to stave off disaster and hold on to millennials buy buying Instagram, while keeping facebook.com as a high-profit environment where they could just bombard vulnerable old people and conspiracy theorists with high margin advertising (kind of like cable news).  But they have failed to capture the younger generation who've moved to TikTok.  And since there is only room for one mainstream social network for every generation, that leaves them with no real avenue for growth.

So the metaverse is a totally impractical hail-marry.  Basically what FB wants to convince you of is that they will be able to construct a compelling virtual reality and productize it faster than TikTok can eat their lunch.

This is an extreme challenge for a number of reasons.  The main one being: what they're describing is *incredibly* capital intensive.  The amount of compute required to create a persistent interactive virtual reality for the entire world to play in is *orders of magnitude* higher than what's required to host images, videos and comments as they do now.  Who's going to pay for that?  Are advertisers going to pay 100x higher ad-rates to put up a billboard in a totally un-tested platform when they can just buy ads on TikTok instead?

Maybe we'll get a metaverse someday, but at best it's decades away, and it's going to happen bottom-up from the expansion of MMO's and platforms like Roblox.  It's not going to happen because a failing social network, with zero competency in the space, needs it to prop up their share price.

75,infinite money glitch (not patched),"after losing most of my money on options, ive come to realize that the best way to make consistent gains is to have more money to put in the market.

enter the plan i came up with after failing my geology exam. 

1. apply for fafsa and use my scholarship to pay my tuition.

2. apply for my university covid relief fund, exaggerate the numbers to receive the full $10,000

3. create an LLC

4. apply for a small business loan through my LLC using the fafsa & covid money as collateral to make up for my lack of business history, aim for $50,000 at 4% apr (made these numbers up in my head)

5. deposit the money directly into my ‚ÄúLLC‚Äôs‚Äù brokerage and enable margin trading to get up to 8x leverage with 7% margin interest.

6. my LLC will have gone from $20,000 cash to $400,000 in buying power (20x leverage) which will strictly be used on options to provide even more leverage. 

7. beat 11% to pay down interest, keep the profit. even a 20% year ($80,000) would net me $36,000 after paying interest. this is more than my original collateral.

8. if my LLC loses all of its money, the company will declare bankruptcy and i will lose the collateral but i will not be liable for the $400,000 in losses.",ssvi19,7488,684,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ssvi19/infinite_money_glitch_not_patched/

84,There Won‚Äôt Be A War In Ukraine Because Russia Already Won,"These are the opinions of a person that comes from a culture very similar to that of Russia and you Westerners need to start understanding just how different we view things. 

Russia‚Äôs objectives was never to start an open conflict with Ukraine, it was to increase its influence in the region, particularly amongst the states that once formed the Soviet Block and due to the utter buffoonery of the United States, Russia‚Äôs plan is a bigger success than it could ever have hoped for. Let me explain. 

You see, unlike the USA, Russia and other eastern countries don‚Äôt view open conflict as a preferred solution. Why? Because we don‚Äôt treat war as a business model. We prefer cleaner, and longer lasting options. Just think about it, Russia has nothing to gain from going to war and almost everything to lose. Just look at their investment into the Nord Stream pipelines and how their GDP is dependent on oil and LNG exports and you know I‚Äôm right.  

The biggest mistake America and its Western allies always make time and time again with Russia and China is to think that conflict will always be a militaristic one, but in reality, trolling and subversion can have a far greater impact than any army ever could, and Russia, just trolled the fuck out of the US. By moving part of its army close to the Ukrainian border and acting somewhat hostile but not hostile enough for it to trigger open conflict, Russia was able to get a knee-jerk emotional response from the United States. This came in the form of rapid deployment of troops and the supply of armaments, but most importantly, it caused warmongering rhetoric from the current administration. And this, is what Russia really wanted. 

You see, Ukraine was always concerned about Russian aggression, but never concerned enough to cause widespread panic amongst its populace, and believe it or not, they are more focused on domestic and economic issues rather than Putin‚Äôs shenanigans. This is because unlike the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ukraine‚Äôs current government is fully in control of the country and Ukrainians are more united than ever, so the prospect of a full-scale Russian invasion that will result in the deaths of millions will always be a microscopic one. 

But that is not what the US thinks. The US, thinking that conflict can only ever be solved through who has the most guns, immediately started beating the war drums and Joe Biden even went as far as to create a literal fucking date for the invasion which was originally this Wednesday before moving it to this Saturday. This kind of rhetoric is carried by the corporate media for the entire world to see and spread and fear and panic amongst global investors. That fear and panic got so fucking bad, it literally ends up causing the Ukrainian economy to go into freefall, costing the country untold billions of dollars‚Äô worth of damages every day. It has now gotten so bad; the fear being spread by US media is now doing more damage than the actual Russians. Don‚Äôt believe me? Check out this chart of the Ukrainian Hryvnia to the USD. 

&#x200B;

Want more proof? David Arakhamia, the leader of Ukraine‚Äôs parliament said the following: **""There is always a threat from the outside. But! Remember the escalation last spring? Today's situation is no worse than that - it's roughly in the same range, Why is the Western media making such a big deal out of it? It's hard to say,""** **Arakhamia remarked. Any surprises can be expected from \[Moscow\], we must be ready for anything, but not amplify panic.**

**This is diplomat speak telling the US media to shut the fuck up.** 

Now for the icing on the cake, even the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement, asking Western media outlets to put out dates of which Russia will invade Ukraine so that Russian diplomats can schedule their vacations around it. They are fucking laughing at you. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wsojif1v4ii81.jpg?width=1090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3782d65f605dc599c79f9a96d7fab034ef943587

Don‚Äôt even make me get started on Ukraine‚Äôs own president trolling social media by posting that he expects an imminent invasion later this week, which he later clarified to be a joke designed to target the fear mongering caused by the US media. 

Now you might be asking yourself, why does this make Russia the winner? Because it damages US credibility and causes its allies in the region to question the ability of the US to protect their interests. Right now, the United States is causing panic that is crippling Ukraine‚Äôs economy and all Russia has to do is to say to the Russian population how justifiable its military exercises are because of how radical the West has become. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are already hammering out a diplomatic solution without the US at the table. The Ukrainian president already heavily hinted that they will not be joining NATO, saying that a NATO membership is akin to ‚Äúhaving a dream‚Äù and Russia in turn is openly supporting recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both situated in eastern Ukraine as independent states, which mean Russian backed rebels will finally stop fighting Ukrainian troops. This would mean that not only, will Ukraine probably never join NATO, Russia just secured another buffer zone against the west via the formation of two new independent countries. Countries, that Russia almost have complete control over. 

What‚Äôs more is that other countries in the region are openly seeing the damage the US is causing and are most likely privately questioning whether or not it‚Äôs a good idea to get the US involved in their affairs if Russia decides to become aggressive again in the future, and they will. Why? Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre Lithuania, a NATO country and Russia starts doing their ‚Äòmilitary exercises‚Äô along your eastern border. You can call in the US, but if you do, chances are, the US is going to cause far greater economic harm than Russia ever could. So what are you most likely going to do? Call in the US and watch as their media tanks your economy or just sit down with the Russians and hammer out a diplomatic solution so you both keep chugging along and tell the US to fuck off if it pokes its head into your internal affairs? It‚Äôs not a hard decision. 

In summary, this is death by a thousand cuts. Russia is going to keep on chipping away at the faith ally countries have both in NATO and the US until they view these two things as borderline obsolete. So, without firing a single shot, Russia can eliminate, through time, NATO and American influence in the region all the while forming its own deals and alliances until it is once again the biggest player in that region.

Another aspect as to why Russia has already won that is not discussed nearly enough is the imminent signing of the new Iranian nuclear deal. Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran‚Äôs lead negotiator just publicly stated that they are close to a deal with the US and that a signing is just days away. This info, combined with Biden‚Äôs recent statements that they are working hard to lower prices at the pump can only mean one thing: Iran is going to start supplying the United States with oil. Iran, in case you people don‚Äôt know, is one of Russia‚Äôs closest allies in the middle east. So as Iran is supplying oil at the pump, Russia is going to start whispering ideas into Iran‚Äôs ear, trying to use them as a middleman in order to push Russia‚Äôs agenda into Washington via shady lobbying dollars. 

Also, on a side note, Iran selling oil is really going to piss off the Saudis since they are sworn enemies. This matters a lot because Saudi Arabia, via an agreement in the 1970s, has agreed to trade their oil exclusively in USD, meaning the USD is NOT a true fiat currency, hence we can print so much without real consequence. This means the US needs to find a way to placate them. This would most likely mean the US will have to take part in additional wars in the middle east to help the Saudis expand their influence, so hooray for that. 

One last thing, don‚Äôt count too much on shale, Biden‚Äôs ban on drilling on federal land just got lifted in December and its unclear how fast US production can pick up. Apparently, betting everything on the multi-trillion-dollar BBB plan with inflation running rampant thinking the country can just seemingly transition to green energy is not the smartest thing to do. 

https://energyfuse.org/biden-abandons-plans-to-curtail-drilling-on-federal-lands/

In conclusion, you Americans need to understand that a large chunk of the world doesn‚Äôt think the way you do. While the timelines for your objectives typically last until the next election, ours can last years, decades, sometimes even generations if need be. Don‚Äôt be too surprised, our countries have thousands of years‚Äô worth of history, while yours started not even 300 years ago. Everything you think of as unfathomable; we have experienced countless times. Revolutions, invasions, dynasties, even genocides. Time has taught us patience, and its time you learned it as well.",sv6clr,7120,1758,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sv6clr/there_wont_be_a_war_in_ukraine_because_russia/

I've been collecting and publishing data on stock trading by US politicians, and wanted to share a list of some of most well-timed moves by our elected officials this past month. 

If there's sufficient interest, I will post a list of the top 5 worst moves tomorrow.

Top 5 best moves

1. **Purchase of $QQQ puts with a $285 strike and a March 18th expiry by Senator Tuberville on December 29th.** While these contracts are up less than they were a week or so ago (when they soared over 400%), the timing on buying way out-of-the-money put contracts on tech was excellent nonetheless.
2. **Purchase of $PXD on December 14th by Rep. Kevin Hern.** This well-timed move into Pioneer Natural Resources has granted Hern (a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources) almost 30% returns in what has been a red month for the market as a whole.
3. **Sale of $FB stock on January 14th by Rep. Garamendi.** I don't think I need to say too much about this one, other than that Garamendi dodged the largest one-day value drop in stock market history.
4. **Sale of $AFRM stock on December 28th by Rep. Gottheimer**. With $AFRM down over 42% since this sale, Gottheimer (a member of the House Committee on Financial Services) managed to avoid the fintech loss that many WSBers could not.
5. **Purchase of $DVN stock on December 30th by Rep.

The technical outlook provided above may appear a bit overwhelming from the first glance, but I‚Äôll explain everything in a *sec*.  


&#x200B;

# I. Elliot Waves and Fibo:

https://preview.redd.it/44h7jobja7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28783785d3c2fc25de11c9b21221d0b1a1d9e535

  
The horizontal üåà lines you see on the chart above is the Fibonacci retracement tool, the measurement starting point is applied to April 3rd 2020 low of about three bucks (shorting hedgies surprised Pikachu face type of reversal), and the top point is Jan 27th 2021 inter-day high of about $450; this period constitutes GME phoenix-like reversal and the first chapter of the short squeeze of everything (squeeze your nuts yourself you fucking bot). Just a quick reminder, that Fibo is used by ‚Äòtraders (anagram)‚Äô for measuring the potential corrective move, and 0.786 Fibo is a sweet and attractive level to hug and support the 2nd, corrective Elliot Wave - EW (for the in-depth discussion of why 0.786 is the perfect level for the price to touch down during a correction, refer to the Big Short 2.0 linked in the second paragraph of this post). All in all, 78.6% retracement level is one of the strongest support levels for the global bull trends that exist, and GME recent price action is the perfect manifestation of that. Therefore I really doubt that we will go below $100 in the near future.

04|03|20-01|27|21 bullish price action used for initial Fibo measurement, imho, also awesomely corresponds to the first Elliot wave of the global bullish impulse. The rest of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 price action incorporates into corrective EW 2 perfectly, in its turn. This one is characterized by lengthy consolidation around $180 (average) followed by a tasty 0.786 dip. The new-born Feb 2022 uptrend is just the beginning of the fresh 3rd EW intensive bullrun, and let me quote Wikipedia here, on its characteristics:

‚ÄúWave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend. The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone looking to ""get in on a pullback"" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave three's midpoint, ""the crowd"" will often join the new bullish trend.‚Äù

Wave 3 is my favorite EW, and for GME it will be juiiiicy!

  


# II. The year-long resistance and moving averages:

https://preview.redd.it/bmn9exjsa7i81.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75294d0b4fd86a9ec1746554189201056d8b5138

This one is really interesting. Take a look at two pink resistance lines first. The thinner, straight one is what I originally identified as the main 2021 GME resistance about half a year ago: all of the previous cyclical bull runs (as well as the original January Sneeze breakout) were caught by it and subsequently reversed; three out of four from those cycles resulted in the powerful false breakouts - which illustrates grotesque selling pressure above this trend line (margin call protection squad maybe?). The dramatic reversal and subsequent bearish price action of each cyclical pattern take up to 90% of each cycle, and that automated, algorithms driven nasty pattern is aimed at keeping the broader investors circle uninterested in the asset, while trying to exhaust the existing buyers and shake weak hands. Well, it looks like there are no weak hands left (thanks 0.786 Fibo supportive buying pressure, coming mostly from üíéüôåüíé direct registering shares), so buckle the fuck up, autist, this rocket goes to moon with or without you.

Furthermore, take a look at the thicker, curved pink resistance which is steeper than the one discussed previously - this reflects additional ~~short dick pain~~ selling pressure inserted on the stonk starting last November. This beautiful smooth line covers all of the false breakouts - and it also incorporates the complete EW2 price action, acting as a resistance through Dec21-Jan22 (almoasst on the chart above) and currently (LFG). You may notice on the chart above, that the price is now trapped between pink curved resistance and the red 21 day exponential moving average - which acts as a strong local support for the newly commenced bull trend.

Speaking of moving averages. 21D exponential MA is used by traders for identifying the trend locally. For GME it clearly acted as an intermediate support during the uptrend phase of the cycle morphing into resistance for the bearish phase (check the chart above for sup/res). Now it‚Äôs SUP, and flipping sup/res usually last for weeks! 80, 150 and 200 day are major simple moving averages which are used for a longer term trend identification, and those were rejected as supports one by one in Jul, Oct, and Dec 2021 accordingly. Now they act as magnetising resistance levels, begging for the penetration from the downside - if you know what I mean.

The parameters outlined above represent the major resistance zone of $120-$200, breaking through which will shoot the apes into space. Wen break? etaSon:

# III. RSI and cycles:

Futures cycles theory simplified for dummies through TA: check RSI at the bottom, which perfectly structures into the u/W shaped cycles - where peak zones correspond with the quarterly futures rollover dates/periods. Firstly, this RSI trending does not look like normal behavior at all. GG, take a look at this gay bear robo algo pathetic shorting, instead of Porn Hub for once, damn it!

Each time, after that red RSI downtrend completes, we approach quarterly bullrun‚Äôs acceleration (purple arrows pointing up). Notice, how Relative Strength Index shoots to its upper gray resistance towards the end of each cycle, and currently we have plenty of RSI upside left. That, in turn, points at the aggressive bullrun in the next couple of trading days. Especially considering that:

GME 4H chart, cup and handle completed LFG Cup and handle reversal formation has just been completed on 4H, just above diamond handed 0.786 Fibo support, which is ultra bullish. Who ordered nuclear sandwich for breakfast: notice, how the shape has been forming in between blue Fib and pink year-long resistance, and how handle is supported by daily 21 EMA - what a goddamn juicy technical picture! All that is left is to FUK!

# V. In conclusion, I came:

**TR;CR: GME is set for one of the strongest breakouts and bullruns since Jan 2021. The price action, which had been suppressed through the entire year, has just bounced off the strongest supports that exist, that is 78.6% retracement level (of the entire bullrun from $3). Furthermore, the stonk is entering Elliot Wave 3, that has to be the most intensive one in the structure. Locally, a juicy cup and handle formation has just been completed, which is set to send the price action to 170-200 range, penetrating and conquering the most important resistance zone. The local price action is further supported by 21 exponential moving average, and the futures cycle completion will also push the price hard in the next couple of trading days. All in all, lets fuk, LG!**

99,We are in the early stages of an inflation driven financial crisis,"I keep coming back and commenting this over and over, hoping more people take heed. Decided to finally make a post in hopes a few people will read it.

This dip is NOT about the FOMC meetings or heightening tensions with Russia. Those are short term catalysts.

The real problem is inflation.

# 7% CPI and 10% PPI is a financial crisis.

Everyone with a formal education in economics and finance knows it, but they are not going to say it because panic from the top won't help anyone. AND RIGHTLY SO.

I swear to God 90% of the investors and traders on reddit don't understand the basics of monetary policy and the risks associated with compounding inflation.

You have to understand that our entire central banking system, and government financial structure is all based on controlling price levels with interest rates.

If inflation runs away, interest rate hikes are the ONLY proven tool to get it under control.

We have not seen this shit in 40 years, and last time we did interest rates had to go to 20% in a ""shock and awe"" style monetary tightening.

Everyone who knows anything about public finances knows that we will all be cavemen if interest rates go to 20%. That means we cannot do that again this time. And THAT means we have no idea how to stop this inflation if it doesn't stop itself.

*EDIT: Added some comments to prove the above point. Here is a source for the reality of the US debt situation, and what will happen if interest rates return to their historical mean of 5%. This is from a report written by the non-partisan US congressional budget office. and it was written BEFORE the stimulus packages were passed and accounted for. These are projections for the relationship between debt and GDP. This is NOT a graph of absolute deficit levels. This is a graph of the US government going bankrupt if interest rates go too high.*

[Full report here: https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/publication\/56977](https://preview.redd.it/dnibpudq2qd81.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=58e84f52c1e56d9b4b6fd50005c73fcbcc80e451)

The above graph explains to you in one image why the US government cannot and will not raise interest rates meaningfully. *(But there's even more reasons than that. A lot more.)*

THIS IS A MONETARY PICKLE OF DILDO PROPORTIONS.

Until inflation comes down materially, do not expect the markets to be anything but bloody.

**Inflation started taking off in March and April of last year. Watch for the month to month changes to start flattening then, because we will be comparing to an already increased month in 2021.**

**Conversely, if we are still getting increasing monthly YOY reads (7%+) on the March and April numbers (which are reported in April and May respectively), that is when all hell will break loose, because it will be an indication that the fed is genuinely losing control.**

PAY ATTENTION TO INFLATION, AND LISTEN TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE REAL WORLD.

My biggest fear is that posts and memes about inflation are going to take over social media, and when the whole world is talking about inflation, its going to cause even more inflation by driving up people's inflationary expectations.

Hyper inflation is caused by inflationary expectations leading to more inflation, which raises inflationary expectations... which guess what? Causes more inflation and increases inflationary expectations further.

At some theoretical point people are going to lose their shit when they feel this in the real world - maybe its gas at $10 a gallon? Maybe it's $15 bread?  I don't know the threshold for real world panic, but can you see the risk here when you dump this gasoline on facebook, twitter and tiktok?
